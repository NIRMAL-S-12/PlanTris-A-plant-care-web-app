					<h4><b> Treatment : </b> </h4>
                    <h6>
                        Target spot is a fungal disease that can affect tomato plants. It typically starts as small, circular spots on the leaves that grow larger over time, with a distinctive bullseye-like pattern. Here are some remedies that you can try to control target spot disease in your tomato plants:

                        <hr><b>1: </b>Remove infected leaves: As soon as you notice any signs of target spot, remove the affected leaves and dispose of them immediately. This will help prevent the spread of the disease.

                        <hr><b>2: </b>Fungicide spray: You can use a fungicide spray that contains copper or chlorothalonil to control target spot disease in your tomato plants. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label carefully when applying the fungicide.

                        <hr><b>3: </b>Neem oil: Neem oil is a natural remedy that can help control target spot disease. Mix one tablespoon of neem oil with one gallon of water and spray the solution on the tomato plants, focusing on the leaves.

                        <hr><b>4: </b>Improve air circulation: Good air circulation can help prevent target spot by reducing the humidity around the plant. You can prune the lower branches of the plant and space your plants farther apart to improve air circulation.

                        <hr><b>5: </b>Water at the base: Water your tomato plants at the base instead of from above to prevent the leaves from getting wet, which can promote the growth of the fungus.

                        <hr>Remember to always read the label and follow the instructions carefully when using any fungicide or pesticide on your tomato plants.
