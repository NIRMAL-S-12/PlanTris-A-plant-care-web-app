                        Late blight is a serious fungal disease that can affect tomato plants. It can quickly spread and cause significant damage to your plants. Here are some remedies that you can try to control late blight disease in your tomato plants:

                        <hr><b>1: </b>Remove infected leaves: As soon as you notice any signs of late blight, remove the affected leaves and dispose of them immediately. This will help prevent the spread of the disease.

                        <hr><b>2: </b>Copper fungicide: Copper fungicide is an effective remedy for late blight disease. You can use a copper-based fungicide spray on your tomato plants, following the instructions on the label carefully.

                        <hr><b>3: </b>Improve air circulation: Good air circulation can help prevent late blight by reducing the humidity around the plant. You can prune the lower branches of the plant and space your plants farther apart to improve air circulation.

                        <hr><b>4: </b>Baking soda: Baking soda is another natural remedy that can help control late blight disease. Mix one tablespoon of baking soda with one gallon of water and spray the solution on the tomato plants, focusing on the leaves.

                        <hr><b>5: </b>Use resistant varieties: Some tomato varieties are more resistant to late blight than others. When choosing tomato seeds or seedlings, look for varieties that are resistant to late blight. This can help reduce the risk of infection.

<hr>Remember to always read the label and follow the instructions carefully when using any fungicide or pesticide on your tomato plants.
